# New_York_City_Taxi_Trip_Duration  
  
The notebook is used to analyze the taxi trip duration in New York City in 2016.  
  
I am trying to build a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City, and visualize the data.  
Also, I try to explore the spatial and temporal behavior of the people of New York as can be inferred by examining their cab usage.  
  
The process is showed in the [notebook](https://github.com/louispoweichen/New_York_City_Taxi_Trip_Duration/blob/master/New_York_City_Taxi_Trip_Duration.ipynb).
